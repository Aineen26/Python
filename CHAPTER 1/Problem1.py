In A Royal in Paradise, struggling novelist Olivia Perkins escapes to the tropics after a breakup, 
only to fall for Alexander, a man who claims to be a regular traveler but is actually the Prince of Toravia.
As they bond over island adventures, Alexander’s secret is eventually exposed by his royal security,
and the romance is further threatened by his mother, Queen Patricia, who deems Olivia an unsuitable commoner.
Heartbroken, Olivia returns to New York and channels her experience into a new book, which becomes a hit. 
The story concludes when Alexander defies his mother’s wishes and travels to New York to find Olivia, 
proving his love is real and giving her the real-life happy ending she had stopped believing in.
